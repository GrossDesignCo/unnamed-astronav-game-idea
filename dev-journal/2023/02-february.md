## Tractor beam/grav-gun idea

Theoretically infinite range but it loses strength with distance.

Similar to actual gravity

Tactically it works like a game of chicken, wanting to not activate it until you know it will be strong enough to work

Also doesnâ€™t stop existing momentum, meaning it can lead to wild swings and slingshots, could lead to woms really wild portal-style orbital physics puzzles

Too many fun ideas for this game. This must be what real game devs feel like all the time.
