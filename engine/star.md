# Star Notes

Object (base class, covers core physics)

Radiation Hazard
- reduces ship integrity by some amount / second
- maybe square root of ship distance * mass of star
- should be almost nothing when out in the system, but increase to instant death at some critical range, depending on the ship (if we do multiple kinds of ships?)

Math:

Damage (integrity/s) = star mass (kg) / sqrt(distance from ship (km))

Need to figure out how "integrity" is computed /modified
