# UI Notes

Controls:

Pan (x, y)

Zoom (z)

Rotate (?)
- seems kinda weird, but maybe?
- might give people vertigo

Scale objects (0-N)
- 1 would be actual size
- realistic solar system scale would be kind of boring to look at / hard to see
- warp distances somehow so that the view gets more zoomed in the closer it gets to an object
- similar to Homeworld Remastered setting (?)

Pause

Speed (0-N days/s)
- default to 0.25 maybe?

Show paths of each object for the next N days

Save
- objects
  - all data
- date/time
- settings (speed, zoom, etc)
