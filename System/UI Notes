# UI Notes

## Controls:

Pan (x, y)

Zoom (z)

Rotate (?)
- seems kinda weird, but maybe?
- might give people vertigo

Scale objects (0-N)
- 1 would be actual size
- realistic solar system scale would be kind of boring to look at / hard to see
- warp distances somehow so that the view gets more zoomed in the closer it gets to an object
- similar to Homeworld Remastered setting (?)

Pause

Speed (0-N days/s)
- default to 0.25 maybe?

Save
- objects
  - all data
- date/time
- settings (speed, zoom, etc)

## View:

Tracks the center of mass of the system (all objects)

As the user moves around, view is constantly adjusted to keep the system in view, even if the whole system is gradually moving away from (0,0)

Show paths of each object for the next N days
