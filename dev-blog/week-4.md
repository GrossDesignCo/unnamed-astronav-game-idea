## Thank the Lord for web technologies

24 hours in to working in js/canvas and it's like a breath of fresh air.

I didn't realize how frustrated I was getting with the Unreal Editor. I'm sure the engine itself is fine, but the editor took 5-10 minutes just to start up, contained 15 billion settings and shaders I didn't want (even with the most minimal setup), took up multiple gigs of ram to have open, and turned the laptop into a furnace.

Also it killed the fun of just coding for me. Blueprints are a neat way to visualize logic, but they (and most everything else about the Unreal Editing experience) were just too much of what I didn't want, and not enough of what I did.

There's such a tight loop now between what I'm coding, what I'm seeing on the screen, everything. It's smaller, more lightweight, simpler.

I'm probably just happy to be back in a space that I'm familiar with. I'm sure all the things that I want to do are totally possible in either straight C++ or Unreal or Unity, since none of it is really that complex (at least so far).

The best piece of advise I saw while comparing game engines to custom code was: "Use whatever framework you already know". There's cool stuff to be built, and the best tech stack is the one we can actually get stuff done in.

## Goals for this week

1. Don't even bother computing motion (for now)
2. Generate the _expected_ position of each body for the next 30 adys
3. When we get to a circle for the moon and a much smaller circle for earth, then we can run motion and see if the predicted matches actual
4. Learn more orbital mechanics and math
