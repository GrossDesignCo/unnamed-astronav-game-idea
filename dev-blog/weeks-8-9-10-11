## Ideas

### Pathing

Compute positions for each given time, then push those into a fifo array of some length, so that we can always have positions up to X seconds in the future and in the past.

That way the user, or the AI, can look ahead, have predicted trajectories, as well as trails, but we're only computing 1 step's worth of positions per step, instead of re-predicti by the whole paths over and over

Maybe then the machine learning can make a distinction between it's smaller, shorter calculations and the world's "true" paths, allowing for error and correcting for it

The ship would have to recalculate it's path based on user input & actions, but at least the other stellar objects wouldn't be affected by it (yet), so they can use the pre-computed world paths

### Loader

Make a neat loading element based on the functions, like "Creating Stars" then planets, asteroids, computing trajectories, initiating navigation...

### Zoom

Basic scroll listener, sets a manual multiplier on the intrinsic view size

In & out, no min max for now.

Either multiplier or some exponential function?

### Make a star pls

In code pen maybe, figure out St√•lberg's Townscaper hex to tri to quad grid generator
