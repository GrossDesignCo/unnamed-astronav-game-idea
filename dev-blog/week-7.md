## Balancing Work & Life

Last week I made some progress on the moons of Saturn & rendering rings around a planet based on real data. Then got sidetracked defending something like work-life balance, and so this project got pushed to the side for a few days.

In that spirit, I've roughly re-prioritized this project at about the "Playing video games" level. It makes sense to give this as much attention as is fun and fulfilling, but to keep it at a P2 compared to things like family & the day-job.

## Goals for this week

1. Get up a basic live url to share with peeps who are interested to see what's going on.
2. Solve the delta-time issue. Staring at ridiculously fast spinning objects is only good for motion-sickness :)

And that's it. This week is probably going to be on the busy side, so let's start small.
