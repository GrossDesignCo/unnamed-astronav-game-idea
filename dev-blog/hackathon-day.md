# Hackathon, 2022

Back from the break!

Hackathon ideas, 2 days to just work on this:
- generate systems instead of hard coding
- save systems/game state in local storage
- ability to share/favorite/spotlight generated systems?

- Ship transit, make something that moves
- test possible interfaces for controlling the ship
- one direct control, like keyboard interface
- one remote control, order ship to a point or object & let ai figure out the rest
