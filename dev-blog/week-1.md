This week I logged a bunch of ideas for ways to convert an AI-based space-navigation simulator into an indie game :)

And got started on a basic cartesian physics engine.

First step goals:

- Get basic project structure together
- Get planet classes to a basic state where they orbit each other

## Game Ideas

Considerations

- balance between simple game & capable AI navigation sim
- need impotice for AI ships to get from port to port

Ideas

Maybe long term the player owns a spaceport and is trying to mine asteroids

- like a space-based backwards mini-motorways
- ports send ships out to asteroids & hope they get baxck in time to keep station from dying
- player decides where to build/what to name ports based on some resource count

Maybe player is managing colonies & trading food for minerals

- keeping their station's people alive
- at the mercy of little AI controlled ships that bring shipments from one port to another
- can start/name/grow new colonies
- maybe some economics based on colony metrics, like supply/demand of food/water/metal/fuel, hunger levels?
- Teach players to manage logistics in orbit, like a Space-UPS sim
- receive requests from ports for shipments from other ports
- Assign ships to waiting stacks of shipments

Maybe automated civilian transports, but a player-controlled set of military ships, guarding from space-pirates or a rival faction?

- would teach AI to have to respond to erratic human commands & destinations
- player would get to watch their fly around via physics & learn orbital mechanics for themselves
- Waves of alien attacks that get faster and bigger until the player is overwhelmed!
  - increasingly complex systems
  - increasingly aggressive aliens
  - ability to build more-better ships to fight the aliens with
- Conpetitive mode
  - two players start on different planets
  - have to expand/out-mine each other
  - maybe survive aliens attacks longer than the other
  - destroy all each other's ships/ports
