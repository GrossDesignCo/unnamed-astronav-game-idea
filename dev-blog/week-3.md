Last week was a lot of engine learning & not much else. Goals for this week:

1. More Engine Learning, Specifically:
1. How to draw a 2D circle around a sphere in-game (make white outlined planets)
1. How to get the scale of the physics right. Distance, mass, G, and time are still tiny compared to what they should be (maybe need to migrate to UE5)
1. How to Draw lines in front of and behind objects to represent their paths

If we get ambitious, maybe:

1. Do up some simple 3d asteroids
2. Start on a basic ship class that can do some basic actions
