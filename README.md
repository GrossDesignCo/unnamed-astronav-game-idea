# sim-ai-rocket-controller

Stub. Tracking notes for a game idea. AI controller for a simulated rocket

## Rocket/spaceship
* imperfectly known and/or variable mass, fuel, thrust capability, fuel/thrust ratio
* intensity of burn increases strain on ship, reduces integrity
* mass decreases as fuel is burned
* fuel/thrust ratio worstens as ship ages (can get repaired at ports)
* occasional randomized breakdowns (eg. lose a thruster or something)
* basic physics

## Neural/AI of some kind, train AI to efficciently navigate the system
* ???

## System
* Zoom in/out
* Pan around
* 2D to start, maybe 3D later
* Realistic scale/sizes
* 1-2 Stars (or maybe 0-N objects of random mass?)

## Base Object class
* Mass/Gravitational pull
* velocity
* direction
* volume/size

## Planets
* Basic physics
* Rotational momentum, mass, gravity
* Should make slingshot maneuvers possible :)
* gravity affects the ship & other objects
* Ports that the ship is trying to get to

## Asteroids/hazards
* Basic physics
* gravity affects the ship & other objects

## Goals
* get from one point to another
* Conserve fuel
* Conserve time
* Conserve strain on the ship / maintenance cost
* Don't crash
* Keep ship from losing integrity

## Game Ideas
* maybe long term the player owns a spaceport and is trying to mine asteroids, like a space-based mini-motorways
* Or player is ordering journeys between certain ports and the AI has to fulfil those journeys
* maybe player is managing a fleet
* maybe player is fighting a war between two factions and AIs are controlling ships??
