# System Generator Notes

## Names for places

Maybe pull in a list of place names and randomly combine words, so like "New London", or "Great Win Shang", or "Dubai" maybe.

## Placements & velocities

Start with a star, then place other stars and planets & asteroids around it

Figure out the right velocities and directions to point each body

Generate asteroid belts?

Place starting location(s)?

It would be neat to place a small red dwarf star out in the system with a couple planets between it and the main star, but far enough that it wouldn't perturb their orbits too much
- maybe even figure out clusters of Trojans like the ones around Jupiter
