# System Ideas (levels?)

Earth and Moon

- super basic, two bodies and a ship maybe, get the player used to the mechanics
- earth is spinning constantly
- moon is tidally locked to earth though, so station always facing inward?
- or maybe a station at the earth-moon Lagrange?

Sum, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Moon

- Simulate the Messenger mission?
- https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/messenger/in-depth/
- maybe hopefully a slingshot in there?

Mine the Jovian Moons

- Saturn (or a big ringed thing)
- bunch of small moons
- lots of small asteroids to gather resources from?

Binary/theoretical systems

- multiple stars
- odd orbits
- maybe rapidly decaying orbits, have to save people from a doomed planet?

Maybe our whole solar system

- would be tricky to scale in a way that was visually interesting
- all the planets
- few hundred asteroids in the asteroid belt (or as many as make sense)

Generate random/procedural systems
- Use different colored gradients for backgrounds
- very faint occasional stars to help give a sidereal frame of reference
- strive for beauty

Save/Load systems, history
- store positions of objects every second
- create a slider that allows player to go forwards & backwards
- creates a lighter-weight store for state data
