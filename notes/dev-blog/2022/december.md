I've started dreaming about orbital mechanics and space battles.

Most recently about two capital ships in one part of the system, and a civilian/converted station in another

The two capital ships have two enemy ships warp in almost right on top of them.

The two enemy ships are slightly stronger and slightly faster, and immediately start burning in opposite directions to try to separate my two ships

Realizing this, I burn my two ships towards the weaker of the two enemy capital ships to take advantage of their separation instead, catch one and knock it out.

The other one is strong enough that it might be able to take both my ships if it got lucky, so I burn hard for the nearby planet

Slingshotting around, my ships are now screaming towards it head-on & fire missles into it's trajectory crossways as it goes in to follow my ships in the slingshot

Catching it & destroying it with the surprise missles, my ships are now screaming towards the civilian group further out-system that's under attack by yet a third enemy ship

So that's new.

I really want to see this game come to fruition.
