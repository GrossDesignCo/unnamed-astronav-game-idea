# January

Path forward, goals for a hackathon day:

- create a play/pause state switch
- pause triggers the path prediction
- phase 2 of pause allows a user to set burns and course corrections
- phase 2 depends on introducing thrust to ships

If nothing else, that would give us a functional ship orbit/flight-path playground to mess around with
