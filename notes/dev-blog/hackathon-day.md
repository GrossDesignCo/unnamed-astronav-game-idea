# Hackathon, 2022

Back from the break!

Hackathon ideas, 2 days to just work on this:

Backend mechanics 
- generate systems instead of hard coding
- save systems/game state in local storage
- ability to share/favorite/spotlight generated systems?

In-game mechanics
- Ship transit, make something that moves
- test possible interfaces for controlling the ship
- one direct control, like keyboard interface
- one slingshot-style interface, define a direction and a burn time/power
- one remote control, order ship to a point or object & let ai figure out the rest
- maybe define a hyperspace mechanic (exponential acceleration like the high school novel concept)
- maybe zoom in/out and select focal points somehow, save focal points and zoom level to keys on the keyboard (like views 1,2,3)
- test control schemes, selecting ships, keyboard inputs, play/pause

Design stuff
- figure out a way to visualize the flow of gravity around the space
- make some fancy space-themed buttons!
- make some cool ship designs (Figma or code?)
- finally make asteroid designs (Figma or code?)
