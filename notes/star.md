# Star Notes

Object (base class, covers core physics)

Big white filled circle instead of circle that's outlined like planets

Soft white glow coming off

Thin red dashed line around it that marks wherever ships should avoid to keep from getting too close

Radiation Hazard

- reduces ship integrity by some amount / second
- maybe square root of ship distance \* mass of star
- should be almost nothing when out in the system, but increase to instant death at some critical range, depending on the ship (if we do multiple kinds of ships?)

CME/Solar Flare Hazard

- wave of energy radiating outward in a certain direction
Math:

Damage (integrity/s) = star mass (kg) / sqrt(distance from ship (km))

Need to figure out how "integrity" is computed /modified

## Types of Stars

Sol (basic star)

- Medium mass
- radiation

Black Hole

- REALLY big mass
- radiation
- time dilation/relativity

Red Giant?

- Medium mass
- Large radius
