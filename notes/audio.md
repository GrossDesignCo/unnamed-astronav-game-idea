# Audio

As a part of the backdrop, it would be cool and useful to make some kind of auditory manifestation of what's happening on screen

Basically be playing deep low tones constantly in the background, but then play a higher, or raise the tone when objects approach each other and accelerate, to help the player take in what's happening

Maybe tone is tied to proximity
Maybe acceleration?

Each pair of bodies plays a note
Therefore the changes in the notes depend on how many bodies there are
Earth and moon would be a very simple pair
Saturn and its moons would be much more complex
