# Audio

As a part of the backdrop, it would be cool and useful to make some kind of auditory manifestation of what's happening on screen

Basically be playing deep low tones constantly in the background, but then play a higher, or raise the tone when objects approach each other and accelerate, to help the player take in what's happening

Maybe tone is tied to proximity
Maybe acceleration?

Each pair of bodies plays a note
Therefore the changes in the notes depend on how many bodies there are
Earth and moon would be a very simple pair
Saturn and its moons would be much more complex

Maybe instead of playing a continuous tone that's a function of closeness, get a few scales together that are complimentary, then use a step function of some kind to switch between notes. That way instead of a continuous rise and fall overlapping for each planet, it's a series of individual notes that are rising and falling, more like windchimes than an aegean harp

Maybe use different waveforms for different objects to create contrast
- sine wave for planets, nice and smooth
- sawtooth or square wave for ships, rougher, more like a rocket engine :)
