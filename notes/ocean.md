# Ocean Notes

## Waves

100x100 (XxY) grid creating a vector field

Or maybe a hexagonal grid?

Some start event, or randomly initialize direction and magnitude

Each point takes in force from it's neighbors

Create a gradient from white to black representing the direction and magnitude of force

## Ship

Affected by the waves that are right around it

Also user can push in some direction

## Clouds

Opportunity to experiment with procedural generation

Clouds get dark and stormy as the waters become more chaotic
