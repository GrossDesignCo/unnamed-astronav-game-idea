# UI Notes

## Controls

Pan (x, y)

Zoom (z)

Rotate (?)

- seems kinda weird, but maybe?
- might give people vertigo

Scale objects (0-N)

- 1 would be actual size
- realistic solar system scale would be kind of boring to look at / hard to see
- warp distances somehow so that the view gets more zoomed in the closer it gets to an object
- similar to Homeworld Remastered setting (?)

Pause

Speed (0-N days/s)

- default to 0.25 maybe?

Save

- objects
  - all data
- date/time
- settings (speed, zoom, etc)

Auto save?

## View

Tracks the center of mass of the system (all objects)

As the user moves around, view is constantly adjusted to keep the system in view, even if the whole system is gradually moving away from (0,0)

Show paths of each object for the next N days

## Visuals

### Stars

Solid white disc
Gradient white to black indicating radiation

### Planets

White circle
White/light grey line indicating future path

Some kind of topography maybe to help visualize spin

Some way to visualize the gravity wells and directions of pull across the system

### Ships

Player color
Little flame for thrust, changes size based on thrust value
Little stat lines like fuel & integrity
