# Thoughts on Time-Scaling

If 1s = 1 Day:

- Moon orbits earth every 30 seconds
- earth spins kinda overly fast (1r/s)
- earth orbits sun every 6 minutes

1s = 0.33 Day:

- Earth orbits sun every 18 minutes
- moon orbits earth every 90 seconds
- earth takes 3 seconds to make a full revolution

Maybe play with planets that rotate slower (or on more tilted axis?)
